# CS-370-TreasureHuntGame
TreasureHuntGame is a pathfinding AI project. It is a game where the player needs to find the treasure before the AI pirate agent does. Using a deep Q-learning algorithm, the pirate learns the optimal way to find the treasure from any position on the map.
The algorithm used achieves a 90.5% win rate against the given player in less than 7 minutes. The pirate agent starts out with no knowledge of the environment and within the first 20 games learns how to win, consistently beating the player for the following 180 games.
This project uses the TensorFlow and Keras libraries in Python to implement deep reinforcement learning and to solve the pathfinding problem.
